# TheaterDesigner_WPTheme

I decided to dabble in creating a custom Wordpress theme. When I was at Emerson (10 years ago), I struggled to find a WP theme that would work well for creating a portfolio as a Designer for stage productions. In creating my first custom theme, I decided to solve that problem, and create the theme I would have used back then.

### Navigation and Widget Areas
I called it Theater Designer, kept the design simple and functional. The navbar functions as a widget area.

As does the sidebar.

### HTML Styles
The HTML styles reflect practical usage, you'll see the different headers around the site in the screenshots.
